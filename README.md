# movie-result

Simple one off page that has a collapsable navigation menu (turns into mobile hamburger menu) and will show the results for movies that contain "coach" in the title.

Bottom of the page has an 'Add Content' section where if you click the button you can add movies based on your own search term.

Page to see this in action: https://andrew-sotiriou.github.io/movie-result/dist/index.html

TO DO:

Should clean up the JS
Should make this more ES6
Troubleshoot github pages
